  <p>The Blacklist (Sky Living) is not to be taken seriously. That much is obvious from the opening scene, in which a dodgy bloke in fedora and shades strolls into the lobby of the FBI building past a bulletin board listing "The FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives" – put there, presumably, as an invitation to visitors to say, "Oh, that guy? The mass murderer? He's in the Costa round the corner."

</p>
  <p>The real-world FBI does publish a list of its 10 most-wanted, but I doubt it pops it up in the lobby for guests to have a gander at. I suspect the list is there to tell us that the dodgy bloke who has just strolled in is a wanted man. In case we thought the avalanche of armed guards who rush out to detain him was normal visitor-welcome procedure.

   <p>This top-10 troublemaker is devilish anti-hero Raymond "Red" Reddington, a Moriarty figure with the ostentatious sophistication of Hannibal Lecter, played with a gleeful superiority by James Spader. Red is a hero turned whistleblower turned mastermind, back after years on the run, wheeling and dealing with the world's worst, and now ready to turn them all in – but refusing to discuss it with anyone except rookie criminal profiler Elizabeth Keen.

</p>
<p> The central question is: why her? But the troubled young hardarse is drawn in such broad brushstrokes that it is difficult to care. Keen's mysterious past is forced down our throats. We get repeated references to her troubled childhood, absent criminal dad, and a burn mark she likes to rub when anxious. Her seemingly idyllic home life appears to consist of her husband repeating the word "family" to her as if teaching her how to pronounce it.

</p>
<p>Flimsy characters aside, the episode plays out like a Michael Bay film, with crashing cars, gunfights, explosions and more than one gory stabbing. In one credulity-testing scene, Keen thrusts a pen into Red's carotid artery, with almost no consequences. The plot writhes to maintain interest, but never quite wriggles away from cliche.
