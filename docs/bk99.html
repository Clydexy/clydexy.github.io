  <p>This award-winning US sitcom starring Andy Samberg is set in a New York police precinct - and brings some light relief to the dawn we're witnessing in copper TV
</p>
  <p>Blue is the warmest colour when it comes to recent TV. Cops have been everywhere. BBC2's breakneck nail-biter Line of Duty may be done and busted but ITV's rapid-response unit Law and Order: UK is back in frontline service for its eighth series in five years. Channel 5's daringly improvised, surprisingly effective and utterly overlooked Suspects will return later this year, while over on Sky Atlantic there's still a lot of unfinished business to deal with in True Detective.</p>
  <p>Each of these shows has its own distinct merits, but apart from the occasional rubbery faced reaction shot from Bradley Walsh in L&O: UK, none could be described as a laugh riot. Even Channel 4's much-trumpeted, Danny Boyle-directed pilot for Babylon – a prickly, satirical helicopter-view of the Met encompassing everything from doofus bobbies on the beat to spineless spin doctors – wasn't really that funny. Ambitiously conceived and stylishly shot, yes, but hardly a LOLcano. (OK, there was a good gag about gluten-free Pom-Bear crisps, but that's about it.)

  <p>That's perhaps why it's so easy to fall for the siren song of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, E4's low-stakes, pop-savvy workplace sitcom that just happens to be set in a Brooklyn police precinct. The first season recently concluded in the US with a mild ratings uptick to 2.6m viewers, apparently enough for Fox to order a second season. In truth, it would have been a crime if Brooklyn Nine-Nine hadn't been recommissioned, especially after it triumphed over more-established rivals to win two Golden Globes in January (Best TV Comedy Actor for Andy Samberg's performance as Jake Peralta – an immature braggart who also happens to be a gifted and intuitive detective – and Best TV Comedy). It must have seemed like kismet for E4, which had already scheduled Brooklyn Nine-Nine to launch the week after the ceremony. Three months in, it has performed well, but I'm hoping that positive word of mouth – and E4's habit of repeating the show all over the place – will push it toward even greater prominence.

</p>
  <p>While it's unlikely that people will ever pore over Samberg's response to a teen vandal who claims to be an immortal Highlander the same way that True Detective fans obsess over references to the Yellow King, I like the way Brooklyn Nine-Nine consistently comes up with robust, ripely comedic plots and then buffs up every crackerjack line to an arresting chrome shine. It also comes in easily digestible half-hour chunks, which can feel like a blessed relief when you're staring down the barrel of another feature-length episode of Endeavour..</p>
  <p>The UK is currently midway through the first season, a discombobulating flurry of themed episodes dealing with Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. But after the holiday shenanigans are over, things settle down into an even more confident groove. There's a sense that show creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur, both veterans of the slightly more wholesome Parks and Recreation, feel they've satisfactorily established the dynamics of the ensemble cast and are now focusing on deepening the characters and relationships.</p>
  <p>Peralta is the smartass precinct golden boy – the Mahoney, essentially – who has his larky fiefdom disrupted by the arrival of a new authority figure. Captain Holt, played by Homicide: Life on the Street veteran Andre Braugher, is buttoned-up, exacting and exceptionally intimidating, the legacy of being a gay black man trying to make it as a cop in the 1970s. Braugher's immovable deadpan expression in the face of even the most ridiculous squad-room hijinks is Brooklyn Nine-Nine's most reliable source of laughs. A forthcoming episode where the usually imperturbable Holt becomes addicted to a silly match-three mobile game called Cwazy Cupcakes – a regrettable situation that requires him to repeatedly utter the phrase "Cwazy Cupcakes" – immobilised me more effectively than a Taser-and-tear-gas special.</p>
  <p>Despite the Brooklyn setting, there aren't that many jokes about hipsters, although the klutzy Boyle (manic-stare-and-pratfall-expert Joe Lo Truglio) is a committed gourmand who spins out almost hypnotic roll calls of artisan ingredients and sophisticated dishes when he's not stubbing his toe or tumbling down fire escapes. In fact, Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn't seem particularly interested in mocking its setting, or even the cops in general – it's more concerned with how our unavoidable interactions with colleagues and co-workers can pirouette from wishing them a slow and painful death to cathartic affection in a microsecond, depending on the demands of each working day. It's a show with real heart. And Highlander jokes.

</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Think of it as Parks and Recreation with more handcuffs. That sounds sexy, right?
